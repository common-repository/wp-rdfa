wp-RDFa brings the semantic Web to WordPress

== Description ==

wp-RDFa brings the **Semantic Web** to your WordPress blog. Currently this plugin supports **FOAF** and the **Dublin Core**.

FOAF is Friend of a Friend, and can be used to relate your personal information to your blog. It can also be used to relate other users of your blog to you building up a semantic map of your relationships in the online world.

wp-RDFa uses the Dublin Core markup to tag posts with the title, creator and date elements.

wp-RDFa has a settings page to allow you customise your relationships with other users of your WordPress site. See the [screenshot](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-rdfa/screenshots/) for a preview of the admin panel.
